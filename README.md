# REDigest
REDigest: a Python GUI for *In-Silico* Restriction Digestion Analysis for Gene or Complete Genome Sequences

## Dependencies
REDigest is written in **Python3**, not adapted for python2 and its dependencies.

To use REDigest, following dependencies must be installed, (for python3, version â‰¥) 

1. tkinter (8.6)
2. Biopython (1.77)
3. Pandas (1.1.1)
4. Matplotlib (3.3.1)

## Running REDigest

### With virtualenv (recommended)

In order to keep the REDigest requirements from clogging up the system dirs, it is recommended to install these in a virtual environment. This is also recommended in order to keep required packages at their proper versions.

```
# make the virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# activate it (Linux/Mac)
source venv/bin/activate

# (or) activate it (Windows)
venv\bin\activate.bat

# install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After setting up the virtual environment, it simply needs to be activated before running the software. After activating, the software is executed by running
```
python REDigestGUI.py
```

### Without virtualenv

#### On windows
* Add execution permission if necessary to script `REDigestGUI.py`

    *In the order of priority*
1. Double click to open the REDigest GUI
2. In command prompt type and execute `python3 REDigestGUI.py`

#### On Linux/MacOS
* In terminal, add execution permission if necessary with `sudo chmod +x REDigestGUI.py`

    *In the order of priority*
1. In terminal type and execute `python3 REDigestGUI.py`
2. In file explorer, right click on file and execute **Run in terminal**
3. Double click to run REDigest GUI **NOTE:** *this option might not work on some linux distro, depending on the system permissions*
