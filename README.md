# REDigest (version 3.0)
REDigest: a Python GUI for *In-Silico* Restriction Digestion Analysis for Gene or Complete Genome Sequences

## Dependencies
REDigest is written in **Python3**, not adapted for python2 and its dependencies.

To use REDigest, following dependencies must be installed, (for python3, version â‰¥) 

1. tkinter (8.6)
2. Biopython (>=1.78)
3. Pandas (>=1.1.1)
4. Matplotlib (>=3.3.1)
5. Numpy

### NOTE: 
- The GUI interface app tkinter is available by default in Python3 and do not require to be installed separately. 
- **In case you get tkinter error, update or reinstall tkinter.**
- Instructions regarding tkinter installation can be found at https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html

## Running REDigest

### With virtualenv (recommended)

In order to keep the REDigest requirements from clogging up the system dirs, it is recommended to install these in a virtual environment. This is also recommended in order to keep required packages at their proper versions.


### make the virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
### activate it (Linux/Mac)
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

### (or) activate it (Windows)
```
venv\bin\activate.bat
```

## install required packages

### update the environment 

```
pip install -U setuptools wheel
pip install -U pip
```

### download the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/abhijeetsingh1704/REDigest
cd REDigest
```

### install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After setting up the virtual environment, it simply needs to be activated before running the software. After activating, the software is executed by running
```
python REDigestGUI.py
```


# GUI tab for restriction digestion analysis

### Without virtualenv

#### On windows
* Add execution permission if necessary to script `REDigestGUI.py`

    *In the order of priority*
1. Double click to open the REDigest GUI
2. In command prompt type and execute `python3 REDigestGUI.py`

#### On Linux/MacOS
* In terminal, add execution permission if necessary with `sudo chmod +x REDigestGUI.py`

    *In the order of priority*
1. In terminal type and execute `python3 REDigestGUI.py`
2. In file explorer, right click on file and execute **Run in terminal**
3. Double click to run REDigest GUI **NOTE:** *this option might not work on some linux distro, depending on the system permissions*

# Update (version 2.0)
1. Improved cluster plot
2. New Histogram plot
3. Ten cluster plots for 10 parts of input data 
3. Ten histogram plots for 10 parts of input data
